            review:
                "Before getting coached by Erik, I had been training in the gym for about 4 years. Of which most of the time I had practically no idea of what I was doing and how I should be training. Ofcourse I got stronger but I also got fat and was just eating very unhealthy. When starting with Erik I learned that getting fit isn't just training. It's about food, sleep, water intake and also the right kind of training. With Erik I lost a lot of weight while keeping (maybe even gaining muscle). I FEEL better and I'm also doing better in all aspects of my life. I'll be continueing my coaching by Erik because I know it is actually worth it.",

                "My favorite recipe is definitely the protein pancake! I'm eating it everyday!",
            favExercise:
                "Although I liked them all, I think my favorite was the chest supported lat pulldown.",
